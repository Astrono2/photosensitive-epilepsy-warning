			Hi there! Welcome to PEWâ€™s home page. Here youâ€™ll find information on us, epilepsy, and other sensory disorders as well as cool and supportive organizations.

		<p>
			But first, what is PEW? And who is it for? PEW is a browser extension with the intention of helping people with photosensitive epilepsy determine what content is and isn't safe to watch online. However, itâ€™s also thought and made for anyone with a sensitivity for flashing lights, bright and vibrant colors, etc. Such as, anxiety, autism, migraines, ADHD, Tourettes, PTSD, and more.

			<p>Here are some NGOs (Non-governmental organizations) we got in contact with (or that we just found helpful) while making <b>PEW</b>. They helped us get a better understanding of what we could do and implement in this project to make the best it can be and actually useful to people with epilepsy.</p>

			<h2>Why we made PEW?</h2>
			<p>The idea for PEW was born from a school project that we needed to do as part of our final year of school. We all wanted to do something that would benefit society in some way.</p>
			<p>The only conditions that had to be met were: it had to be carried out throughout the school year and it had to be technology related. Almost halfway through the year we were given a talk about accessibility and other issues the school wanted us to aim for with our proyects. That's when we came up with this idea of creating software that would allow people with epilpsy to navigate the web safely and freely. We asked if there was something like this already and we disaappointed but not surprised when we were told that it hadnâ€™t. That as when we decided we would do it ourselves.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Youâ€™re more than welcome to send us any feedback or maybe updates youâ€™d like for us to implement. (Or anything really, we love cat pics)</p>
